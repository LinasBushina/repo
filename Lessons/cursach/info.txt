//printf asm on win10 vs2017
1) You'll need to add these libraries to your dependencies: libcmt.lib, libvcruntime.lib, libucrt.lib, legacy_stdio_definitions.lib. Alternatively you could use includelib to include these libraries in your assembly file.
2) Specify C calling convention for your main procedure using PROC C
3) At the end of your file (and this is important) do not use end main, use end only. Not fixing this may cause unexpected crashes.
4) Although we can use ExitProcess to exit our application, we can also put the return code in EAX and do a ret to return. The C runtime calls our main function, and will call the shutdown code for us upon returning.
